# 🛠️ Microcontroller Software Developer | Embedded Systems Enthusiast

## About Me
Hello! I'm **Repvi**, a developer passionate about building efficient and scalable **microcontroller software**. My expertise lies in **C** and **C++**, but when it comes to embedded systems, I prefer using **C**—especially for ESP32 development.

I enjoy crafting **custom subsystems** for microcontrollers, focusing on **debugging tools, performance optimization**, and **handling complex system interactions**. Whether it's building a **firmware architecture** or designing **low-level drivers**, I thrive on creating robust and adaptable solutions.

## What I Work On
- 🔹 **ESP32 Firmware Development** (Optimized for efficiency)
- 🔹 **Embedded Debugging Systems** (Custom logging, diagnostics)  
- 🔹 **Real-Time Systems & Task Management** (RTOS-based solutions)  
- 🔹 **Microcontroller Subsystems** (Power management, communication, control handling)  

## Why Microcontrollers?
I believe embedded systems are the backbone of modern technology. Designing low-level software allows me to **push hardware to its limits** and develop **highly efficient, task-specific subsystems**.

## Languages & Tools
- **💻 Primary Languages:** C (Preferred), C++  
- **🔧 Debugging & Development:** JTAG, UART debugging, logic analyzers  
- **🔗 Communication Protocols:** SPI, I2C, UART  
- **📟 Real-Time Frameworks:** FreeRTOS, custom RTOS implementations
